## Fullstack Developer

Hello, everybody, my name is **Kaloyan Yosifov** and I am a Fullstack developer
at <a href="https://scayle.com" target="_blank">Scayle</a>.

At my free time, I am learning something new every day and enjoying the process of opening myself to new opportunities. Sometimes I start small projects and apps to test an Idea, a programming language or for improving my skills. Check them out at <a href="https://github.com/KaloyanYosifov" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

I've been programming for almost 10 years now and still loving it! Something about creating an app, website or a game is extraordinary.

Currently I am enjoying the process of learning more about Cryptography, Security and Privacy. I am also tickling my curiosity in the blockchain space.
