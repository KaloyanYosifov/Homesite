## Fullstack Developer

Hello, everybody, my name is **Kaloyan Yosifov** and I am a Mid Level Full Stack developer
at <a href="https://htmlburger.com" target="_blank">HTMLBurger</a>.

At my free time, I am studying about new tricks and more in programming. Sometimes even creating my own utilities, libraries or starting a
big project. Check them out at <a href="https://github.com/KaloyanYosifov" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

I've been programming for almost 8 years now and still loving it! Something about creating an app, website or a game is extraordinary.

Currently I am working towards shifting my career choice of being a developer for the web, but rather for a Blockchain and systems.
