## Fullstack Developer

Hello, everybody, my name is **Kaloyan Yosifov** and I am a Fullstack developer
at <a href="https://taprolabs.de" target="_blank">Tapro Labs</a>.

At my free time, I am learning something new every day and enjoying the process of opening myself to new opportunities. Sometimes I start small projects and apps to test an Idea, programming language or a fun exercise. Check them out at <a href="https://github.com/KaloyanYosifov" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

I've been programming for almost 10 years now and still loving it! Something about creating an app, website or a game is extraordinary.

Currently I am enjoying the process of learning more about Haskell and Plutus, to develop apps for the Cardano ecosystem!
